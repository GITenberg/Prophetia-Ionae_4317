Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

PROPHETIA IONAE.

I       1 Et factum est verbum Domini ad Ionam, filium Amathi dicens:
 2 Surge, et vade in Niniven, civitatem grandem, et praedica in ea,
quia ascendit malitia ejus coram me.  3 Et surrexit Ionas, ut fugeret
in Tharsis a facie Domini, et descendit in Ioppen; et invenit navem
euntem in Tharsis, et dedit naulum ejus, et descendit in eam ut iret
cum eis in Tharsis a facie Domini.

4 Dominus autem misit ventum magnum in mare; et facta est tempestas
magna in mari, et navis periclitabatur conteri.  5 Et timuerunt
nautae, et clamaverunt viri ad deum suum, et miserunt vasa, quae
erant in navi, in mare, ut alleviaretur ab eis: et Ionas descendit ad
interiora navis, et dormiebat sopore gravi.  6 Et accessit ad eum
gubernator, et dixit ei: Quid tu sopore deprimeris? surge, invoca
Deum tuum, si forte recogitet Deus de nobis, et non pereamus.  7 Et
dixit vir ad collegam suum: Venite, et mittamus sortes, et sciamus
quare hoc malum sit nobis.  Et miserunt sortes, et cecidit sors super
Ionam.  8 Et dixerunt ad eum: Indica nobis cuius causa malum istud
sit nobis: quod est opus tuum? quae terra tua? et quo vadis? vel ex
quo populo es tu?  9 Et dixit ad eos: Hebraeus ego sum, et Dominum
Deum caeli ego timeo, qui fecit mare et aridam.  10 Et timuerunt viri
timore magno, et dixerunt ad eum: Quid hoc fecisti? (Cognoverunt enim
viri quod a facie Domini fugeret, quia indicaverat eis.)  11 Et
dixerunt ad eum: Quid faciemus tibi, et cessabit mare a nobis? quia
mare ibat, et intumescebat.  12 Et dixit ad eos: Tollite me, et
mittite in mare, et cessabit mare a vobis: scio enim ego quoniam
propter me tempestas haec grandis venit super vos.

13 Et remigabant viri ut reverterentur ad aridam, et non valebant,
quia mare ibat, et intumescebat super eos.  14 Et clamaverunt ad
Dominum, et dixerunt: Quaesumus Domine, ne pereamus in anima viri
istius, et ne des super nos sanguinem innocentem: quia tu, Domine,
sicut voluisti, fecisti.  15 Et tulerunt Ionam, et miserunt in mare:
et stetit mare a fervore suo.  16 Et timuerunt viri timore magno
Dominum; et immolaverunt hostias Domino, et voverunt vota.

II      1 Et praeparavit Dominus piscem grandem ut deglutiret Ionam:
et erat Ionas in ventre piscis tribus diebus, et tribus noctibus.  2
Et oravit Ionas ad Dominum Deum suum de ventre piscis.  3 Et dixit:

Clamavi de tribulatione mea ad Dominum, et exaudivit me:
    de ventre inferi clamavi, et exaudisti vocem meam.
4 Et proiecisti me in profundum in corde maris, et flumen circumdedit me:
    omnes gurgites tui, et fluctus tui super me transierunt.
5 Et ego dixi: Abiectus sum a conspectu oculorum tuorum:
    verumtamen rursus videbo templum sanctum tuum.
6 Circumdederunt me aquae usque ad animam:
    abyssus vallavit me, pelagus operuit caput meum.
7 Ad extrema montium descendi:  terrae vectes concluserunt me in aeternum:
    et sublevabis de corruptione vitam meam, Domine Deus meus.
8 Cum angustiaretur in me anima mea, Domini recordatus sum:
    ut veniat ad te oratio mea ad templum sanctum tuum.
9 Qui custodiunt vanitates frustra, misericordiam suam derelinquunt.
10 Ego autem in voce laudis immolabo tibi: quaecumque vovi, reddam
    pro salute Domino.
11 Et dixit Dominus pisci: et evomuit Ionam in aridam.

III     1 Et factum est verbum Domini ad Ionam secundo, dicens:  2
Surge, et vade in Niniven, civitatem magnam: et praedica in ea
praedicationem quam ego loquor ad te.  3 Et surrexit Ionas, at abiit
in Niniven iuxta verbum Domini: et Ninive erat civitas magna itinere
trium dierum.  4 Et coepit Ionas introire in civitatem itinere diei
unius: et clamavit, et dixit: Adhuc quadraginta dies, et Ninive
subvertetur.

5 Et crediderunt viri Ninivitae in Deum: et praedicaverunt ieiunium,
et vestiti sunt saccis a maiore usque ad minorem.  6 Et pervenit
verbum ad regem Ninive: et surrexit de solio suo, et abiecit
vestimentum suum a se, et indutus est sacco, et sedit in cinere.  7
Et clamavit, et dixit in Ninive ex ore regis et principium eius,
dicens: Homines, et iumenta, et boves, et pecora non gustent
quidquam: nec pascantur, et aquam non bibant.  8 Et operiantur saccis
homines, et iumenta, et clament ad Dominum in fortitudine, et
convertatur vir a via sua mala, et ab iniquitate, quae est in manibus
eorum.  9 Quis scit si convertatur et ignoscat Deus: et revertatur a
furore irae suae, et non peribimus?

10 Et vidit Deus opera eorum, quia conversi sunt de via sua mala: et
misertus est Deus super malitiam quam locutus fuerat ut faceret eis,
et non fecit.

IV      1 Et afflictus est Ionas afflictione magna, et iratus est: 2
et oravit ad Dominum, et dixit: Obsecro, Domine, numquid non hoc est
verbum meum cum adhuc essem in terra mea? Propter hoc praeoccupavi ut
fugerem in Tharsis: scio enim quia tu Deus clemens et misericors es,
patiens et multae miserationis, et ignoscens super malitia.  3 Et
nunc, Domine, tolle, quaeso, animam meam a me, quia melior est mihi
mors quam vita.  4 Et dixit Dominus: Putasne bene irasceris tu?
5 Et egressus est Ionas de civitate, et sedit contra orientem
civitatis: et fecit sibimet umbraculum ibi, et sedebat subter illud
in umbra, donec videret quid accideret civitati.

6 Et praeparavit Dominus Deus hederam, et ascendit super caput Ionae,
ut esset umbra super caput eius, et protegeret eum (laboraverat
enim): et laetatus est Ionas super hedera laetitia. rnagna.  7 Et
paravit Deus vermem ascensu diluculi in crastinum: et percussit
hederam, et exaruit. 8 Et cum ortus fuisset sol, praecepit Dominus
vento calido et urenti: et percussit sol super caput Ionae, et
aestuabat: et petivit animae suae ut moreretur, et dixit: Melius est
mihi mori quam vivere.  9 Et dixit Dominus ad Ionam: Putasne bene
irasceris tu super hedera? Et dixi: Bene irascor ego usque ad mortem.
10 Et dixit Dominus: Tu doles super hederam in qua non laborasti,
neque fecisti ut cresceret: quae sub una nocte nata est, et sub una
nocte periit: 11 et ego non parcam Ninive, civitati magnae, in qua
sunt plus quam centum viginti millia hominum qui nesciunt quid sit
inter dexteram et sinistram suam, et iumenta multa?
